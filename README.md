Creative Projects 2 

Color Moppy

The Folder holds the final program as well as the prototypes of the project. 

To Successfully run the program yourself you need the following materials:

1. Arduino Board
2. Floppy Drive,up to 7
3. Some jump wires or extra cables to connect the floppy drive to the arduino
4. Power supply. 
5. One LED for testing
6. Laptop with Xcode and Openframewroks installed


In order to conncet the Floppy disk to the arduino there are various online 
tutorials. These are the ones I found most successful. 

When that is done and tested, upload the Standard Firmata Library to 
your Arduino Board. That will allow communication between Openframeworks 
and the Arduino. 

Open the "Creeative Projects 2" program in Xcode and run it.
